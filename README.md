This repository showcases a web-based form with enhanced
validation capabilities. It ensures that users input valid data for fields like name,
email, phone number, and password. The password validation includes a strength
check, requiring a minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, a number,
and a special character. The form provides real-time feedback, highlighting errors
and guiding users to correct their inputs. Upon successful validation, a success
message is displayed, confirming the form submission. This project serves as a
valuable resource for developers looking to implement robust form validation in
their web applications.
